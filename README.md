# Calculator

## Project Overview

A simple calculator to perform arithmetic operations.

## Progress

I've worked on the following features:
- **Basic arithmetic operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Decimal numbers:** The calculator accepts and can operate on decimal numbers.
- **Display:** The calculator displays the current operand being entered, the operation, and the result.

## Learnings

I've learned how to use the event listener 'keydown' to get the calculator take numbers and operate from the keyboard.
It was a bit challenging to make the 'click' and 'keydown' event listeners to work together. But i managed to solve it.
